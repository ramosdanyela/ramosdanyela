## About Me
With over 5 years of experience in the tech industry, Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to work in Customer Success leadership roles, bridging the gap between customers' needs, technical feasibility, and business opportunities.

## Key Contributions:
- Collaborated with enterprise customers to understand complex requirements and translate them into actionable solutions for technical teams.
- Supported Customer Success Managers (CSMs) in "translating" technical details into clear, business-friendly language for HR and leadership stakeholders.
- Authored and maintained documentation for features, business rules, and use cases, ensuring clarity and accessibility for internal public and customers.

My background in both technical and business-facing roles equips me with a unique perspective as a developer, enabling me to craft solutions that are both effective and user-focused.
